# CS-350

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**  
This project involved creating a prototype thermostat using the following hardware: Raspberry Pi 4, Adafruit AHT20 temperature sensor, GPIO breakout board, solderless breadboard. After developing a functioning prototype, I looked at what would be needed to develop the prototype into an actual product.  

**What did you do particularly well?**  
Overall, I think I did a good job developing the code for the prototype. 

**Where could you improve?**
My analysis of what would be required to turn the prototype into an actual product could be improved. Going into this course, I had little knowledge of embedded systems and there are certainly still gaps in my knowledge.  

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**  
The experience gained working with embedded systems will be the most valuable, though other skills, tools, and resources were reinforced with my work in this course.  

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**  
As stated previously, I had little knowledge of working with embedded systems before this course. In this course, I've learned a lot about how embedded systems function and how to develop for embedded systems.  

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
There are a few strategies I used to ensure the project remained maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Firstly, by breaking down tasks into smaller individual chunks, the code should be fairly easy to understand and easy to reuse. Secondly, I utilized descriptive comments to further explain the code. As a result, the project should be easy to understand, easy to update, and easy to reuse.
